# Doctorinna - open-source medical risk factor analyzer
**Authors:** Lada Morozova, Denis Schegletov, Danis Alukaev, Maxim Pryanikov. \
**Group:** B19-DS-01, Innopolis University.

> This is the overview repository primarily used for documentation, for implementation details see [Structure of project](#structure) section

Doctorinna is an open-source application for determining the user's risk group for the widespread diseases by medical parameters. 
This application will allow people in the form of a survey without undergoing a medical examination to understand
whether it is necessary to be examined by a doctor and change their lifestyle.

## Our services
If you want to use our application without installation you can use **[web application](https://doctorinna.vercel.app)** or **[Telegram bot](https://t.me/doctorinna_bot)**

If you want to build our application on local machine use
**[Docker image with stable versions](https://github.com/Doctorinna/overview/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)**

If you want to contribute check **[our API](https://github.com/Doctorinna/backend/tree/dev)**

### Motivation <a name="motivation">  </a>
A modern person prefers not to think about the fact that sooner or later his or her life will end. Our old age is so far away. So much so that it is easy for it to get lost in everyday studies, tedious work, questionable entertainment, quick snacks and hours of communication on social networks.

Doctorinna is our attempt to create a product that sobers the modern generation. This open-source product allows you to determine your risk group for the most common diseases by answering questions related to body parameters, habits and heredity. To do this, machine learning models will be trained on publicly available data from patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and lung cancer. The list of diseases will increase as the project develops. An important feature of the project will be a system of recommendations for improving your health.

Our goal is to distract you from the flow of digital garbage for at least a minute, and ask the question, _what are you doing to live to old age?_


### Structure of project <a name="structure"> </a>
It was decided to build a backend API implemented on the Django REST Framework. It will contain the business logic of the application.

In our opinion, the main flow of users might come through the web version of the application and the Telegram bot. 
Therefore, it was decided to implement them first within the framework of the Software System Analysis and Design course.

Accordingly, the code is distributed into 3 repositories: 
- [Backend](https://github.com/Doctorinna/backend)
- [Frontend](https://github.com/Doctorinna/frontend)
- [Telegram bot](https://github.com/Doctorinna/telegram-bot)

Each repository has a detailed description of how to launch correspondent side of the project locally.

- **REST** - architecture that are typically loosely based on HTTP methods to access resources via URL-encoded parameters and the use of JSON or XML to transmit data.
- **Microservice** - architecture that arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. Opposed to monolithic architecture.
- **CRUD** - Create, Read, Update, Delete - 4 basic operations of persistent storage.

- **Repository** - Github repository of organization Doctorinna.
- **Component (Frontend)** - group of HTML elements, that can be reused multiple times and structuralized code.
- **Logger (Backend)** - log the information about all activities to retrieve bugs more easily.

- **Component (UML)** - modular part of the system that encapsulate the state and behavior of a number classifiers.
- **State manager (Frontend)** - object that controls state in all application and send this state to components.
- **Service (Backend)** - part of the Backend that contains business logic.
- **Controller/urls (Backend)** - part of the Backend that contains sending and receiving information using HTTP methods.
- **Local Storage** - persistent storage in browser that can store key-value pairs.
- **RUP** - Rational Unified Process.
- **SSR** - Server Side Rendering. Technique to render web page in server and deliver to client already rendered (but it can be rerendered later on client side).

- **User** - web Users of the web application or telegram bot.


## Architecture <a name="architecture"> </a>
### Static view <a name="static"> </a>
Static view presents the main modules of the system and their hierarchy in an abstract way

### Dynamic view <a name="dynamic"> </a>
Dynamic view extends the static view by adding the interactions between different components.

## Design <a name="design"> </a>
### Sequence diagram <a name="sequence"> </a>
Sequence diagram presents the sequence of events occurring in the system, interactions between entities and their lifespans.
![](media/sequence_diagram.png)

### Design patterns <a name="patterns"> </a>
The backend side of the application is implemented in Django REST Framework. A significant number of design patterns are used in this framework. Therefore, in the course of our work, we indirectly use them. 

 **Examples of used design patterns:**
 - **Factory design** pattern is used for creation of fields in forms 
 - **Observer** is used to register callback functions executed when fields in models were changed

 For more detailed explanation of used design patterns, please check [Gamma Delivery]().
